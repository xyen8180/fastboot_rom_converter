# fastboot_rom_converter
a simple app to create fastboot rom from miui recovery zip rom.
this is experimental app which is tested and worked on #mi11Ultra aka star for over more than 100 roms (stable, beta, dev of various regions for xdroms, from android 11 to 12 but not tested for android 13)
before going further make sure that whatever happens with your device it's your responsibility not mine. so use it on your own risk
all the future device i'll add support but for now only mi11 ultra is available
for check device availability always for example check branch name mi11ultra branch will be used for mi11ultra device

steps to use it

1. put the downloaded recovery rom on input folder. (make sure only one rom zip present at a time)
2. for windows use "Windows - Make Rom.bat" and for linux use "Linux - Make Rom.sh"
3. after all the process you'll get the rom in output folder.
4. after flashing or using rom use "Windows - Cleanup Rom.bat" or use "Linux - Cleanup Rom.sh depending on your os."

note :- whatever happens with your device it's upto you i'm not responsible for any kind of damage happen to your device either its because of buggy xiaomi rom like poco devices and many xiaomi device. understand i'm not making rom i'm just converting it from existing rom. so it's your responsibility
